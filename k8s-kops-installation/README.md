# Kubernetes Operations (Kops) Installation and Setup on Ubuntu 

This README provides a guide on how to install and set up Kubernetes Operations (Kops) on Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites 

- Ubuntu system (16.04 or higher)
- AWS CLI installed and configured 

## Installation 

First, we need to install Kops. If you haven't done it yet, you can do it with the following commands:

```
wget https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops
```
These commands download the latest Kops binary, make it executable, and move it to /usr/local/bin.

### Cluster Setup
Before creating a cluster, you need to set up a state store. The state store is a remote storage for cluster configuration files. In this case, we're using an S3 bucket in AWS:


```

export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>

```

Remember to replace <your-s3-bucket-name> with the name of your S3 bucket.

## To create a cluster:


```

kops create cluster --name=<your-cluster-name> --zones=<aws-zone> --yes

```

Replace <your-cluster-name> with the name you want for your cluster, and <aws-zone> with the AWS zone you want to use (e.g., us-east-1a).

This command creates a new Kubernetes cluster in the specified zone.

## Verifying the Setup
To verify your setup, you can use the following command:


```

kops validate cluster --name=<your-cluster-name>

```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message saying that your cluster is ready. 

Remember to replace <your-cluster-name> with the name of your cluster.

## Conclusion
Now, you have installed Kops and set up a Kubernetes cluster in Ubuntu. You can start deploying your applications on it.


**NOTE** Remember to replace all placeholders with the actual values related to your environment and needs. 

When entering the bash commands in the markdown file, ensure you start and end with three backticks. This signifies a code block in markdown.
